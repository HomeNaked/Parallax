This is my class project for <code>Louisville.

It will be a parallax scrolling, responsive website that makes use flexbox.

It will have 3 background images that will have some text and 2 solid backgrounds that scroll over the 3 background images.

The first solid area will contain flex items that are icon links to other pages.
The second will be contact.  

I may add more once I get it figured out.
